# ATCommander

Portable C++ library for sending AT commands and parsing their responses

Designed for resource contrained (embedded) environments, but should also be useful elsewhere

As of now this is a *blocking* library.  

## Future plans 

* non-blocking on the read parse
* *maybe* non-blocking on the command write as well
